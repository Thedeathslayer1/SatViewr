Title: 

SatViewr


Abstract

: The game will be a continuation of 
one of the tracks given to the 
participants of NASA spaceapps 
— a
 ﬁrst person or a third person view
from the known satellites around
the earth. It will have multiple 
satellites
which can be switched 
amongst. It will require scripts to be
 written in C# (which is totally new 
for me)
and scenes to be made in
Unity. (Implementation of leap
motion will also tried, which should 
give a more intuitive
user
 experience)
